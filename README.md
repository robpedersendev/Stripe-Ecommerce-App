## Background

​
This project utilizes React and SCSS to provide the front end UI. Netlify is used as a CI/CD provider. This website was started and is continued to learn newer technologies as a personal project. The technologies that this project utilize are:

## Why I'm Proud of this Project

This project will utilize stripe payment processing, Firebase, and it will be converted eventually into an NPM package that will be deployable so anyone can deploy an entire e-commerce site with a few clicks.
